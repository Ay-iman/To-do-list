Dynamic To-Do List

Summary: This script creates a dynamic to-do list application where users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage so that they persist even after the page is reloaded.

This HTML and JavaScript code creates a to-do list application where users can:
Add new tasks by entering text and clicking the "Add Task" button.
Click on tasks to mark them as completed or incomplete (strikethrough text indicates completion).
Remove tasks by clicking the "Remove" button next to each task.
The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist across page reloads.
The to-do list is displayed dynamically, and any changes (adding, completing, or removing tasks) update the list and the local storage accordingly.
